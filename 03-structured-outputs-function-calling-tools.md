# Part 3: Structured Outputs, Function Calling & Native Tools

This section covers three powerful capabilities of the Gemini API: structured outputs for extracting information into defined schemas, function calling for connecting to external tools and APIs, and native tools like Google Search for enhanced capabilities.


```python
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
import sys
import os
from IPython.display import Image, Markdown

IN_COLAB = 'google.colab' in sys.modules

if IN_COLAB:
    from google.colab import userdata
    GEMINI_API_KEY = userdata.get('GEMINI_API_KEY')
else:
    GEMINI_API_KEY = os.environ.get('GEMINI_API_KEY',None)

# Create client with api key
MODEL_ID = "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20"
client = genai.Client(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)
```

## 1. Structured Outputs

Structured outputs allow you to constrain Gemini to respond with JSON in a specific format instead of unstructured text. This is essential for:
- **Data extraction**: Converting unstructured text into structured data
- **API integration**: Getting consistent formats for downstream processing  
- **Database insertion**: Ensuring data matches your schema requirements
- **Quality control**: Validating that responses contain required fields


```python
class Recipe(BaseModel):
    recipe_name: str
    ingredients: List[str]
    prep_time_minutes: int
    difficulty: str  # "easy", "medium", "hard"
    servings: int

class RecipeList(BaseModel):
    recipes: List[Recipe]

# Using Pydantic models for structured output
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents="Give me 2 popular cookie recipes with ingredients and prep details.",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_mime_type="application/json",
        response_schema=RecipeList,
    ),
)

# Get structured data directly
recipes: List[Recipe] = response.parsed
for recipe in recipes.recipes:
    print(f"Recipe: {recipe.recipe_name}")
    print(f"Ingredients: {recipe.ingredients}")
    print(f"Prep Time: {recipe.prep_time_minutes} minutes")
    print(f"Difficulty: {recipe.difficulty}")
    print(f"Servings: {recipe.servings}")
    print("\n")
```

    Recipe: Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies
    Ingredients: ['all-purpose flour', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'unsalted butter', 'granulated sugar', 'brown sugar', 'eggs', 'vanilla extract', 'chocolate chips']
    Prep Time: 20 minutes
    Difficulty: Easy
    Servings: 24
    
    
    Recipe: Chewy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies
    Ingredients: ['all-purpose flour', 'baking soda', 'cinnamon', 'salt', 'unsalted butter', 'brown sugar', 'granulated sugar', 'eggs', 'vanilla extract', 'rolled oats', 'raisins']
    Prep Time: 15 minutes
    Difficulty: Medium
    Servings: 36
    
    


## !! Exercise: PDF to Structured Data !!

Extract structured information from a PDF invoice or document using the Files API and structured outputs.

Tasks:
- A Pydantic schema (`InvoiceItem` and `InvoiceData`) and an example PDF file path (`../assets/data/rewe_invoice.pdf`) are provided. You can use this or replace it with your own PDF invoice.
- Upload the PDF file using `client.files.upload()`.
- Call `client.models.generate_content()`:
- Access the parsed structured data from `response.parsed`.



```python
class InvoiceItem(BaseModel):
    description: str
    quantity: int
    unit_price: float
    total: float

class InvoiceData(BaseModel):
    invoice_number: str
    date: str
    vendor_name: str
    vendor_address: str
    total_amount: float
    items: List[InvoiceItem]

# Upload a PDF file (replace with your PDF path)
pdf_file_path = "../assets/data/rewe_invoice.pdf"

# Upload the file
file_id = client.files.upload(file=pdf_file_path)

# Extract structured data from PDF
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents=[
        "Extract all invoice information from this PDF including items, vendor details, and totals.",
        file_id
    ],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_mime_type="application/json",
        response_schema=InvoiceData,
    ),
)

# Get structured invoice data
invoice: InvoiceData = response.parsed
print(f"Invoice #{invoice.invoice_number}")
print(f"Vendor: {invoice.vendor_name}")
print(f"Date: {invoice.date}")
print(f"Total: ${invoice.total_amount}")
print(f"Items ({len(invoice.items)}):")
for item in invoice.items:
    print(f"  - {item.description}: {item.quantity} x ${item.unit_price} = ${item.total}")
```

    Invoice #7077
    Vendor: REWE Marc Balkow OHG
    Date: 2025-03-29
    Total: $22.67
    Items (10):
      - BUTTERKAESE: 1 x $1.79 = $1.79
      - BRIOCHE BUNS 4ER: 1 x $1.69 = $1.69
      - HUMMUS NATUR: 1 x $0.99 = $0.99
      - SENSATIONAL BUR.: 1 x $3.19 = $3.19
      - BANANE CHIQUITA: 0 x $2.39 = $0.7
      - SUESSKARTOFFEL: 0 x $4.49 = $1.99
      - EISBERGSALAT: 1 x $1.19 = $1.19
      - CHERRYROMATOMATE: 1 x $1.15 = $1.15
      - BIO EIER KL. S-L: 1 x $2.99 = $2.99
      - PISTAZIENCREME: 1 x $6.99 = $6.99


## 2. Function Calling

Function calling allows Gemini to intelligently decide when to call specific functions you define. This enables:
- **External API integration**: Connect to weather, stocks, databases
- **Dynamic calculations**: Perform real-time computations
- **System interaction**: Execute commands or retrieve system information
- **Multi-step workflows**: Chain function calls for complex tasks


```python

def get_weather(location: str) -> dict:
    """Gets current weather for a location.
    
    Args:
        location: The city name, e.g. "San Francisco"
        
    Returns:
        Weather information dictionary
    """
    # Mock weather data - in real use, you'd call a weather API
    weather_data = {
        "temperature": 22,
        "condition": "sunny", 
        "humidity": 60,
        "location": location,
        "feels_like": 24
    }
    print(f"üå§Ô∏è FUNCTION CALLED: get_weather(location='{location}')")
    return weather_data

# Define function declarations for the model
weather_function = {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Gets current weather for a location",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The city name"
            }
        },
        "required": ["location"]
    }
}
tools = [types.Tool(function_declarations=[weather_function])]

# Define user prompt
contents = [
    types.Content(
        role="user", parts=[types.Part(text="Whats the weather in Tokyo?")]
    )
]


# Send request with function declarations
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents=contents,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(tools=tools)
)

# Check for function calls
function_call = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].function_call
print(f"Model wants to call: {function_call.name}")
print(f"With arguments: {dict(function_call.args)}")

# Execute the function
if function_call.name == "get_weather":
    result = get_weather(**function_call.args)
else:
    result = {"error": "Unknown function"}

print(f"Function result: {result}")

# Send function result back to model
function_response_part = types.Part.from_function_response(
    name=function_call.name,
    response={"result": result}
)
# Append function call and result of the function execution to contents
contents.append(types.Content(role="model", parts=[types.Part(function_call=function_call)])) # Append the model's function call message
contents.append(types.Content(role="user", parts=[function_response_part])) # Append the function response

# Get final response
final_response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents=contents,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(tools=tools)
)

print(f"\nFinal response: {final_response.text}")
```

    Model wants to call: get_weather
    With arguments: {'location': 'Tokyo'}
    üå§Ô∏è FUNCTION CALLED: get_weather(location='Tokyo')
    Function result: {'temperature': 22, 'condition': 'sunny', 'humidity': 60, 'location': 'Tokyo', 'feels_like': 24}
    
    Final response: The weather in Tokyo is sunny with a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius, and it feels like 24 degrees. The humidity is 60%.


### Automatic Function Calling (Python Only)

The Python SDK can automatically handle function execution for you:


```python
def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> dict:
    """Calculate the area of a rectangle.
    
    Args:
        length: Length of the rectangle
        width: Width of the rectangle

    Returns:
        Price calculations
    """
    area = length * width
    print(f"CALC: {length} √ó {width} = {area}")
    return {"operation": "area", "result": area}

# Using automatic function calling - much simpler!
config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
    tools=[get_weather, calculate_area]  # Pass functions directly
)

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents="What's the weather in Tokyo and what's the area of a 5x3 meter room?",
    config=config
)

print(response.text)  # SDK handles function calls automatically
```

    üå§Ô∏è FUNCTION CALLED: get_weather(location='Tokyo')
    CALC: 5 √ó 3 = 15
    The weather in Tokyo is sunny with a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius, and it feels like 24 degrees Celsius. The humidity is 60%. The area of a 5x3 meter room is 15 square meters.


## !! Exercise: Calculator Agent !!

Create a set of calculator functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and use Gemini's function calling capability to perform calculations based on natural language prompts.

Tasks:
- Define Python functions for `add(a: float, b: float)`, `subtract(a: float, b: float)`, `multiply(a: float, b: float)`, and `divide(a: float, b: float)`.
- Create a list of these functions (`calculator_tools`).
- Test single operations with `client.models.generate_content()`:
- Test complex expressions with a prompt for a multi-step calculation (e.g., "Calculate (25 + 15) * 3 - 10. Do this step by step.").


```python
def add(a: float, b: float) -> dict:
    """Add two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a: First number
        b: Second number
        
    Returns:
        Sum of the numbers
    """
    result = a + b
    print(f"CALC: {a} + {b} = {result}")
    return {"operation": "addition", "result": result}

def subtract(a: float, b: float) -> dict:
    """Subtract two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a: First number  
        b: Second number
        
    Returns:
        Difference of the numbers
    """
    result = a - b
    print(f"CALC: {a} - {b} = {result}")
    return {"operation": "subtraction", "result": result}

def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> dict:
    """Multiply two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a: First number
        b: Second number
        
    Returns:
        Product of the numbers
    """
    result = a * b
    print(f"CALC: {a} √ó {b} = {result}")
    return {"operation": "multiplication", "result": result}

def divide(a: float, b: float) -> dict:
    """Divide two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a: Dividend
        b: Divisor
        
    Returns:
        Quotient of the numbers
    """
    if b == 0:
        print(f"CALC: Error - Division by zero")
        return {"operation": "division", "error": "Division by zero"}
    
    result = a / b
    print(f"CALC: {a} √∑ {b} = {result}")
    return {"operation": "division", "result": result}

# Test the calculator with automatic function calling
calculator_tools = [add, subtract, multiply, divide]

# Single operation
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents="What is 15 multiplied by 7?",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(tools=calculator_tools)
)
print("Single operation:")
print(response.text)

# Complex calculation
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents="Calculate (25 + 15) x 3 - 10. Do this step by step.",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(tools=calculator_tools)
)
print("\nComplex calculation:")
print(response.text)
```

    CALC: 15 √ó 7 = 105
    Single operation:
    15 multiplied by 7 is 105.
    CALC: 25 + 15 = 40
    CALC: 40 √ó 3 = 120
    CALC: 120 - 10 = 110
    
    Complex calculation:
    Finally, 120 - 10 = 110.
    
    So, (25 + 15) x 3 - 10 = 110.

- Documentation summarization
- Competitive research
- Content extraction


```python
# URL context for analyzing specific web pages
url_context_tool = types.Tool(url_context=types.UrlContext())

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents="Summarize the key features and benefits mentioned on https://www.python.org/about/ in 3 bullet points.",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[url_context_tool],
    )
)

### Code Execution Tool

Gemini can execute Python code to perform calculations, create visualizations, and process data.


```python
# Code execution tool
code_execution_tool = types.Tool(code_execution={})

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents="Create a bar chart showing the population of the 5 largest cities in the world. Use matplotlib.",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[code_execution_tool],
    )
)


for p in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
    if p.text:
        display(Markdown(p.text))
    elif p.executable_code:
        display(Markdown(f"```python\n{p.executable_code.code}\n```"))
    elif p.inline_data:
        display(Image(data=p.inline_data.data, width=800, format="png"))

```


To create a bar chart showing the population of the 5 largest cities in the world, I first need to gather the relevant data: the names of the cities and their estimated populations. It's important to note that city population figures can vary depending on the definition used (e.g., city proper, urban area, metropolitan area) and the source/year of estimation.

For this example, I will use estimated populations for the urban areas of the following five cities, based on common recent data (e.g., from sources like World Population Review, 2023/2024 estimates).

**Cities and their Estimated Urban Area Populations (in millions):**
1.  **Tokyo, Japan:** ~37.2 million
2.  **Delhi, India:** ~32.9 million
3.  **Shanghai, China:** ~29.2 million
4.  **Dhaka, Bangladesh:** ~23.2 million
5.  **S√£o Paulo, Brazil:** ~22.6 million

Now, I will use `matplotlib` to create the bar chart.





```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Data for the 5 largest cities (urban area population estimates)
cities = ['Tokyo', 'Delhi', 'Shanghai', 'Dhaka', 'S√£o Paulo']
populations = [37.2, 32.9, 29.2, 23.2, 22.6] # in millions

# Create the bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) # Set the figure size for better readability
plt.bar(cities, populations, color='skyblue')

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('City')
plt.ylabel('Population (Millions)')
plt.title('Top 5 Largest Cities by Urban Area Population (Estimated)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right') # Rotate x-axis labels for better fit
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7) # Add a grid for better readability
plt.tight_layout() # Adjust layout to prevent labels from being cut off

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```



    
![png](03-structured-outputs-function-calling-tools_files/03-structured-outputs-function-calling-tools_17_2.png)
    



The image you provided, `output_2025-05-30-23-55-48-263270.png`, successfully displays the bar chart showing the estimated urban area populations of the 5 largest cities: Tokyo, Delhi, Shanghai, Dhaka, and S√£o Paulo.

The chart is clear and correctly depicts the data as requested in the previous prompt, with appropriate labels, title, and formatting.


## !! Exercise: Data Analysis with Code Execution !!

Combine Google Search and Code Execution tools to find real-world data and then analyze or visualize it using Python code generated and executed by Gemini.

Tasks:
- Define a prompt that requires both searching for information and then processing/visualizing that information. For example: "Search for the population of the 5 largest cities in the world and create a bar chart of their populations."
- Create a `types.Tool` for code execution: `code_execution_tool = types.Tool(code_execution={})`.
- Create a `types.Tool` for Google Search: `google_search_tool = types.Tool(google_search=types.GoogleSearch())`.
- Call `client.models.generate_content()`:
- Iterate through the `response.candidates[0].content.parts` and display the parts.


```python
prompt = """
Search for the population of the 5 largest companies in the world and create a bar chart.
"""

code_execution_tool = types.Tool(code_execution={})
google_search_tool = types.Tool(google_search=types.GoogleSearch())

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents=prompt,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[code_execution_tool, google_search_tool],
    )
)

for p in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
    if p.text:
        display(Markdown(p.text))
    elif p.executable_code:
        display(Markdown(f"```python\n{p.executable_code.code}\n```"))
    elif p.inline_data:
        display(Image(data=p.inline_data.data, width=800, format="png"))

```


```python
concise_search("5 largest companies by market capitalization")

```



I believe you might be referring to "market capitalization" instead of "population" when asking about companies. I will provide a bar chart of the top 5 largest companies by market capitalization.

Here are the top 5 largest companies by market capitalization as of May 21, 2025:

1.  **Microsoft:** $3.405 trillion
2.  **Nvidia:** $3.277 trillion
3.  **Apple:** $3.089 trillion
4.  **Amazon:** $2.166 trillion
5.  **Alphabet (Google):** $1.997 trillion

Now, I will create a bar chart with this data.




```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data for the top 5 companies by market capitalization
data = {
    'Company': ['Microsoft', 'Nvidia', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Alphabet (Google)'],
    'Market Cap (Trillions USD)': [3.405, 3.277, 3.089, 2.166, 1.997]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create the bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(df['Company'], df['Market Cap (Trillions USD)'], color='skyblue')
plt.xlabel('Company')
plt.ylabel('Market Capitalization (Trillions USD)')
plt.title('Top 5 Largest Companies by Market Capitalization (as of May 21, 2025)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout() # Adjust layout to prevent labels from overlapping
plt.show()
```
